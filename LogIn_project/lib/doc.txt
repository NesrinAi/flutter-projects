hey nono this is my explaination to u <3
the sections are:
- firebase Initialization 
- log in view - bloc provider
- UI - bloc concumear 
- state management 
- logic - cubit & firebase auth

lets break the first section together: 
void main() async {
    widgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
    await FireBase.initializeApp(option :  DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform);
    runApp(const MyApp())
}

we are doing three main things here: 
1- make sure all Flutter services ready before doing anything
(like firebase) 

2- connect the app  to fire base services
the current platform gives firebase the right config for android pr ios

3- run the app 

so in short: 

Wait for Flutter to get ready 
Connect to Firebase 
Then start the UI
